# beeru-redux

## Summary: 
This is the second version of my [beeru](https://github.com/kokosanki/beeru) application. I decided to re-write it in order to practise using Redux. It uses API provided by https://punkapi.com/ and displays various beers. The main feature of the application is the 'favorite' button, which adds a chosen beer to the 'favorites' subpage. The navigation is managed by React Router.

## Technologies:
HTML, SCSS, Javascript, React, Redux
